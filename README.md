# TGT: TGT Generates Terrain
### Terrain Generation via Machine Learning

TGT is being developed to leverage machine learning techniques to assist in terrain generation.  Our eventual goal is to be able to effectively generate terrain and integrate our functionality with [Soul Engine](https://github.com/Synodic-Software/Soul-Engine).

Stay tuned for issues as they become available for opportunities to contribute.
