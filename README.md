TGT is being developed to leverage machine learning techniques to assist in terrain generation.  Our eventual goal is to be able to effectively generate terrain and integrate our functionality with [Soul Engine](https://github.com/Synodic-Software/Soul-Engine).

Stay tuned for issues as they become available for opportunities to contribute.
